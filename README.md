# count-sequences
From a list, count all repeated sequences of min length n, up to max length m.

TODO: Implement sequence tree: Make tree structures starting with each unique item.
      Nodes have count of instances ending at that node.
      Nodes include downward links to children (as a dictionary).
      Nodes include upward link to parent.
      A list of presently active nodes is kept, and used to update the tree after each new item.

TODO: Use one solution as basis for testing and test others against it.

TODO: Run all solutions over multiple data sets as a performance comparison. Generate graphs.

 Try different orders in case it effects caching.

 Try different counts of unique items and list lengths to compare performance.

TODO: Refactor to structure project.

TODO: Document and explain more clearly, what this does, how it works, how it can be used

 (including with parsed data so we can catalog regex matches, while specific text differs.)

TODO: Add copyright and license

TODO: Make one or more packages
